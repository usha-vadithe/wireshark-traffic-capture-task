# Task 5: Wireshark Network Traffic Capture – Cyber Security Internship

## 🎯 Objective:
Capture and analyze real-time network traffic using Wireshark, and identify at least three different protocols.

## 🛠 Tool Used:
- Wireshark v4.x with Npcap driver

## 🔍 Steps Performed:

1. Opened Wireshark and selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi).
2. Started capturing live packets.
3. Performed basic web activities:
   - Browsed websites like example.com, google.com
   - Ran `ping google.com` in Command Prompt
4. Stopped capture after approximately 1 minute.
5. Saved the capture file as `task5-capture.pcapng`.

## 📡 Protocols Identified:

1. **DNS** – Used for domain name resolution (e.g., when accessing google.com).
2. **TCP** – Underlying transport protocol used by most connections.
3. **HTTP** – Detected while accessing unencrypted web pages.
4. **TLS** – Used for HTTPS-secured sites.
5. **ICMP** – Observed during ping requests to external domains.

## 📄 Output:
- File: `task5-capture.pcapng`
- Duration: ~1 minute
- Device: Wi-Fi interface on Windows 10

## ✅ Outcome:
Successfully captured and analyzed various network packets in real-time. Learned how to use filters in Wireshark to identify and inspect protocols like DNS, TCP, HTTP, and TLS. Gained hands-on understanding of live network analysis.
